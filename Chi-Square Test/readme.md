Chi-Square Test Project
Overview
This project demonstrates how to perform a Chi-Square test of independence using Python. The Chi-Square test is a statistical method used to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using the requirements.txt file:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Libraries Used
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
numpy: Numerical operations
scipy: Scientific computing, used here for statistical functions
matplotlib: Plotting and visualization
seaborn: Data visualization based on matplotlib
Files
requirements.txt: Lists the necessary Python libraries and their versions
chi_square_test.py: Contains the main script for performing the Chi-Square test
data/: Directory containing sample data files
Usage
Ensure all required libraries are installed:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the chi_square_test.py script:
bash
Copy code
python chi_square_test.py
Example
Here is an example of how to use the chi_square_test.py script:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load your dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/sample_data.csv')

# Create a contingency table
contingency_table = pd.crosstab(data['Variable1'], data['Variable2'])

# Perform the Chi-Square test
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency_table)

print(f'Chi2: {chi2}')
print(f'p-value: {p}')
print(f'Degrees of Freedom: {dof}')
print('Expected Frequencies:')
print(expected)

# Visualize the data
sns.heatmap(contingency_table, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='YlGnBu')
plt.title('Contingency Table')
plt.show()
Interpretation
Chi2: The Chi-Square statistic value.
p-value: The probability that the observed association is due to chance. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates a significant association between the variables.
Degrees of Freedom (dof): The number of degrees of freedom for the test.
Expected Frequencies: The expected frequency counts for each cell in the contingency table if there were no association between the variables.
Conclusion
This project provides a basic template for performing and interpreting a Chi-Square test of independence in Python. It can be expanded with more complex data and additional statistical tests as needed.
