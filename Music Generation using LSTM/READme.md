# Music Generation Using LSTM
Welcome to the Music Generation Using LSTM project! This project uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to generate music. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that are well-suited to sequence prediction problems, making them ideal for generating music.

## Introduction
This project aims to create a music generation model using LSTM networks. By training the model on a dataset of MIDI files, the LSTM can learn to generate new music sequences that mimic the style of the training data.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

* data/: Contains MIDI files for training and processed data.
models/: Stores the trained LSTM model.
* notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
* scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and music generation.
* README.md: The project's README file.
* requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies needed for the project.

## Installation
To set up the project:

* Clone the repository: Download the project files from GitHub.
* Create a virtual environment: Isolate the project's dependencies.
* Install dependencies: Install the required Python libraries.
## Usage
### Preprocessing Data

### Training the Model

### Generating Music

## Training the Model
The script loads the preprocessed data, defines the LSTM model architecture, and trains the model. The trained model is saved.

## Generating Music
The generate_music.py script uses the trained LSTM model to generate new music sequences. The output can be saved as MIDI files for further use.
